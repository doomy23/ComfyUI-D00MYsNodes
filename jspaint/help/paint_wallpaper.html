	<p><b>Notes</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>JS Paint can't directly set your wallpaper, but it can generate a tiled image the size of your desktop.</li>
		<!-- @TODO: make this note unnecessary? -->
		<li>The <b>Set As Wallpaper (Centered)</b> option doesn't currently use your desktop size, it just saves a copy of the image.
		You need to make sure in your system settings to choose to center the image.</li>
